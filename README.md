```

## Import
### Directly usable
import the directly usable boards
```
from pyqtgameboards.gameboards import QRectangleboard
from pyqtgameboards.gameboards import QHexagonboard
```

### Generic parent class for custom shape grids
or import the parent class QGameboard to create a different style map than the defaults

```
from pyqtgameboards.gameboard import QHexagonboard
```

make sure to super the methods that need specific shape implementation
```
add_shape_to_scene # logic for adding a shape to a grid
get_adjacent_tiles # logic for determining the adjacent tiles
```

## How to
to try out, copying the following to open a widget with a hexagon board
This is a gameboard of 20 rows and 10 columns (feels like 20, as it only counts tiles at the same height)
This example creates designated tiles that receive a green fill with a thick green line

```
import sys

from PyQt5 import QtWidgets, QtGui, QtCore

from pyqtgameboards.gameboard import QHexagonboard

if __name__ == '__main__':

    overlays = []
    overlay1brush = QtGui.QBrush(QtGui.QColor(0,255,0,150))
    overlay1pen = QtGui.QPen(QtGui.QColor(0,255,0))
    overlay1pen.setWidth(3)
    overlay1dict = {
        "Brush": overlay1brush,
        "Pen": overlay1pen,
        "Positions": [
            [1, 1], 
            [2, 1],
            [1, 2],
            [3, 3],
            ],
        }
    overlays.append(overlay1dict)

    global app
    app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
    global main
    main = QtWidgets.QMainWindow()

    main.setCentralWidget(QHexagonboard(
        horizontal = True, 
        rows = 20, 
        columns = 10,
        overlays = overlays,
        ))

    main.showMaximized()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```
